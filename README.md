# Smart Plant Watering
Using this project you can water your plant/s automatically considering external temperature, humidity, light and weather conditions. Also you can use this as a home weather station and check temperature, humidity and lightness from your cellphone or computer just using a browser..

Are you leaving on vacation and nobody is available to water your plants.... this project will help!

Requirements:

    PCB
    ESP8266 NodeMCU
    DHT11 sensor (Temperature & Humidity)
    Relay
    Light sensor
    Box / Container
    Headers
    Water pump (5v - 12V)
    small diameter transparent clear soft hose (may vary based on your water pump connectors)

Currently there are two "stable" releases (feel free to submit bugs/comments if you if find any, so that will help to make it more "stable")

<b>Version 1.03</b> - uses a local web server runningo on ESP8266 so you can check all measurements through the web (i.e. from your cellphone or computer).

<b>Version 2.03</b> - optimized to be running on batteries, so it uses deep sleep mode and publish data to ThingSpeak portal so you can check information from that site.

    For example, I am using this ThingSpeaks channel to publish data from my current smart plant watering esp8266: https://thingspeak.com/channels/504661

Thank you!
